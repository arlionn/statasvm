Project Reference
=================

* [Stata Plugin Documentation](http://www.stata.com/plugins/) -- this is a single page which covers both compilation, usage, and all platforms in one.

* Cross platform build systems:
  * [the git makefile](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Makefile), though this is only for POSIX variants
