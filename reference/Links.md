Project Reference
=================

* [Stata Plugin Documentation](http://www.stata.com/plugins/) -- this is a single page which covers both compilation, usage, and all platforms in one.

* Cross platform build systems:
  * [the git makefile](http://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Makefile), though this is only for POSIX variants




* [Pre-defined C/C++ Compiler Macros Wiki](http://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Home/)
  SO USEFUL

* Sergio Correia has a useful batch of stata up on github, including
  * [the cleanest way to do subcommands](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/stata-misc/blob/master/yaml.ado) (cleaner than e.g. Stata's stdlib import.ado)
