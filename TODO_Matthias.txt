THis is a separate to do LIST by Matthias . THe original from Nick Guenther is very good but too complex for me.


TODO LIST 


[]  zip updates instead of recreating. "make release" should probably erase the old zip first, if it exists. 


[] Remove .DS_store files before or during "make release". To clean up the repository to a pristine state you can use "git clean". 
You should read the instructions it gives you, but it's the best laser scalpel to prevent this sort of thing.
You could also tweak the zip command to specifically exclude the .DS_store files, 
since Darwin is "enthusiastic" about making them so it might be simpler to just hardcode them out. 
I think zip has a flag to do that. I don't recall it off the top of my head, so put that down as another to do.
